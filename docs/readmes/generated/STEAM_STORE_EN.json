  "app[content][about]": "[h2]What is OyasumiVR?[/h2]\r\nOyasumiVR is a desktop application containing various utilities and automations to [b]help you sleep with a virtual reality headset on[/b]. Most of these utilities are built specifically for use within the social vr-platform VRChat.\n\nOyasumiVR can [b]detect when you are asleep[/b], and help you in various ways such as:\n- 🔋 Saving electricity and battery overnight\n- 🔅 Dimming your headset brightness\n- ✨ Triggering avatar animations based on your sleeping pose\n- 📩 Automatically handling invite requests\n- 🎤 Muting your microphone when you fall asleep\n- 🛠️ Automating various SteamVR settings\n\n...and many more! Please see the upcoming \"Features\" section to read more about what functionality OyasumiVR has to offer.\r\n\r\n[h2]Features[/h2]\r\n\r\n[h2]💤 Sleep Detection[/h2]\r\nOyasumiVR can detect automatically when you are asleep, based on your movement! Simply calibrate once, enable the automation, and you're set.\n\nIf automatic detection is not what you're looking for, there's various alternative automations you can use, that are based on:\n\n[list]\n[*]A time schedule\n[*]Controller & tracker battery levels\n[*]Controller & tracker power states\n[*]SteamVR status\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]📲 SteamVR Overlay[/h2]\r\nOyasumiVR comes with its own SteamVR overlay, which allows you control some of its features from within VR!\n\nBy default, double press the A button on your right controller, and it should pop up in front of you.\r\n\r\n[h2]🔋 Power Automations[/h2]\r\n[b]Controllers & Trackers[/b]\n\nAutomatically have your controllers and/or trackers turn off when you sleep, and save their battery! You'll be happy when you wake up in the morning and find they'll still have some juice left in them!\n\nAdditionally, you can have your controllers and/or trackers turn off at certain battery levels, or when you put them on the charger. Ideal for hotswapping controllers!\r\n\r\n[b]Windows Power Policy[/b]\n\nSave some electricity by automatically setting Windows' Power Policy when you go to sleep and wake up! Simply have it set a more conservative policy (like \"Power Saver\") when you go to sleep, and then restore a higher performance policy when you wake up again.\r\n\r\n[b]Base Stations[/b]\n\nHave OyasumiVR turn your base stations on and off together with SteamVR. A bit like SteamVR's own base station power management, but [b]compatible with any HMD![/b] As long as your PC supports Bluetooth and is in range of the base stations, you're good to go.\n\n[i]Currently only V2 Lighthouses are supported.[/i]\r\n\r\n[h2]🔌 GPU Automations[/h2]\r\n[b]GPU Power Limiting[/b]\n\nSave electricity by automatically power limiting your GPU when you go to sleep, and restoring its full power when you wake up! Simply set the desired watt limits and OyasumiVR will set them when needed.\n\n[i]Power limiting is only available on Nvidia GPUs. AMD users can instead make use of the MSI Afterburner automations.[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]MSI Afterburner[/b]\n\nIf you want more control over your GPU than just setting the power limit, you can have OyasumiVR automatically activate the profiles you've set up in MSI Afterburner.\nTweak your over- or underclocks, power limits and more, and have OyasumiVR call for them when you go to sleep, or wake up!\r\n\r\n[h2]💫 VRChat Automations[/h2]\r\n🌜 [b]Sleeping Animations[/b]\n\nOyasumiVR can detect what sleeping pose you are in, and use it to trigger the right animation or pose on your avatar.\n\nThere are built-in presets for popular locomotion assets, including:\n\n[list]\n[*]ごろ寝システム v2.2 - 2.3 by みんみんみーん\n     (Sleep System v2.2 - 2.3 by minminmiin)\n     EX version also supported!\n  \n[*]GoGo Loco v1.7.1+ by franada\n  \n[/list]\n\nAlternatively, trigger your own animations with the included OSC script editors!\r\n\r\n📧 [b]Auto Accept Invite Requests[/b]\n\nAutomatically accept invite requests from specific friends while you are asleep! You can add the friends you want to let in to the whitelist, or even block certain friends from having their requests automatically accepted with a blacklist.\r\n\r\n🔵 [b]Status Automations[/b]\n\nAutomatically change your status based on the number of players in your world:\n\nSwitch to blue when you are sleeping alone so your friends can join you, and switch to orange when there's enough people around!\r\n\r\n🔧 [b]OSC Automations[/b]\n\nYou can send certain OSC messages to VRChat when sleep mode is enabled, or disabled. You can use the built-in OSC script editor to compose the exact messages you want to send.\n\nThis is a more advanced feature that you can use to trigger certain features on your avatar. For example: Show a sleepy expression on your face while sleep mode is enabled!\r\n\r\n[h2]⛔ Shutdown Sequence[/h2]\r\nEver wanted to fall asleep in VR, but not stay in VR all night? The shutdown sequence has you covered!\n\nThe shutdown sequence can trigger automatically when you've been asleep for a certain amount of time. Depending on which actions you configure, it will do any of the following:\n\n[list]\n[*]Turn off your controllers and/or Trackers\n[*]Turn off your Base Stations\n[*]Quit SteamVR [i](And any running game or overlay along with it)[/i]\n[*]Shut down Windows\n[/list]\n\nNow you can fall asleep soundly in VR, knowing that everything will shut down after you've dozed off!\r\n\r\n[h2]🔅 Brightness Automations[/h2]\r\nAutomate your brightness for when you sleep and wake up. OyasumiVR can smoothly transition your VR headset's brightness, so it falls down gradually as you sleep without waking you up.\n\nIt allows you to control both software brightness, as well as hardware brightness if your headset supports it (e.g. Valve Index or Bigscreen Beyond). In addition to providing you with several automations, you can easily control your brightness levels right from the SteamVR overlay menu!\r\n\r\n[h2]🎤 Microphone Mute Automations[/h2]\r\n[b]System Microphone Mute Automations[/b]\n\nOyasumiVR can also do the same, but on a system level, muting your Microphone's audio device instead.\nWith this, you can even switch between mute toggle mode and push-to-talk.\n\nThis comes with an optional mute indicator in the VR overlay, and the option for binding a controller button so that you can have it completely replace the microphone muting functionality of VRChat or any other VR game you play.\r\n\r\n[b]VRChat Microphone Mute Automations[/b]\n\nYou can have OyasumiVR automatically mute or unmute your mic in VRChat when you go to sleep and wake up.\n\nPerfect if you'd like to prevent others from hearing you snore!\r\n\r\n[h2]🔉 Audio Volume Automations[/h2]\r\nAutomatically change the volume of your audio devices when you fall asleep, or wake up! This can be useful if you want to prevent other players, or other applications from disturbing your sleep.\r\n\r\n[h2]♥️ Heart Rate Automations (Pulsoid Integration)[/h2]\r\nTo support heart rate based automations, OyasumiVR integrates with the online heart rate service Pulsoid. For this you can use any hardware that Pulsoid supports, like bluetooth heartrate monitors, WearOS smartwatches, or Apple Watches.\n\n[i]Note that this integration requires a one-time purchase of Pulsoid's OyasumiVR integration, or to have an active Pulsoid \"BRO\" subscription. Please ensure you have a compatible device before making a purchase.[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]Sleep Detection[/b]\n\nYou can set up OyasumiVR to automatically enable the sleep mode when your heart rate has been low enough for a certain duration. Just set the BPM threshold and for how long your heart rate should stay under it, and you're set! If you're not sure, you can get some simple insights to determine the right values for your body.\r\n\r\n[b]Nightmare Detection[/b]\n\nOyasumiVR can detect when you've got a prolonged elevated heartrate, which could indicate a nightmare. With this feature you can try to cut your nightmares short by automatically deactivating the sleep mode (to for example, increase the brightness), or by playing a sound to attempt waking you up.\r\n\r\n[h2]🚨 HMD Specific Automations[/h2]\r\nOyasumiVR has various automations for controlling certain features specific to certain VR Headsets. Currently, this includes the following:\n\n[b]Bigscreen Beyond[/b]\n[list]\n[*]RGB Led Control\n[*]Fan Speed Control\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]👓 Resolution Automations[/h2]\r\nAutomatically adjust your SteamVR render resolution when you sleep and wake up! Having OyasumiVR lower your render resolution helps you reduce the load on your hardware at times when you don't need it.\r\n\r\n[h2]🔳 Chaperone Automations[/h2]\r\nAutomatically adjust the fade distance of SteamVR's chaperone when you sleep. If you have a small play area, you can use this to make sure the chaperone stays hidden while you are asleep, and re-enable it when you wake up!\r\n\r\n[h2]Translation & Localization[/h2]\r\nOyasumiVR currently supports the following languages:\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]日本語 (Japanese): Community contributions by なき and Milix-M.\r\n[*]한국어 (Korean): Community contribution by Soumt.\r\n[*]繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese): Community contribution by 狐Kon.\r\n[*]简体中文 (Simplified Chinese): Community contributions by 狐Kon, 雾雨花精灵 and いんく.\r\n[*]Français (French): Community contribution by neuroblack.\r\n[*]Español (Spanish): Community contribution by aacal666.\r\n[*]Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian): Community contribution by a9ito.\r\n[*]Русский (Russian): Community contributions by Kanjir0, Pacmard and Dimrical.\r\n[*]Nederlands (Dutch): by Raphiiko.\r\n[*]English: by Raphiiko.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Help out with translation[/b]\r\nOyasumiVR would not have supported as many languages as it does without the help of our fantastic volunteers. I personally think it's amazing that thanks to their efforts, more people get to use OyasumiVR than would otherwise have been possible.\n\nIf you want to support us, either by contributing missing translations, or by adding an entirely new language, please check out the wiki page on adding translations for instructions on how to get started! In case you're looking for more information, please don't hesitate to hop in our Discord and ask!\r\n\r\n[h2]Support[/h2]\r\nIf you are having trouble with OyasumiVR, say you have a bug, or a feature request, you can join our Discord server.\n\nAlternatively, you can reach out to me directly on Twitter at @Raphiiko. I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible!\r\n\r\n[h2]License[/h2]\r\nOyasumiVR is available under the MIT license.\r\n",
