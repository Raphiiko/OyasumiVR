# Readme source translations

This directory contains the source files used to generate the localized readme files and store descriptions.

If you want to edit a readme file or store description, this is the place to do it.

You can generate the output for these files by running `npm run generate-readmes` or `yarn generate-readmes` in the root directory.
The output will appear in `docs/readmes/generated`.
